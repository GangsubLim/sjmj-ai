# Coding Style

## Immutability (CRITICAL)

ALWAYS create new objects, NEVER mutate existing ones:

```
// Pseudocode
WRONG:  modify(original, field, value) → changes original in-place
CORRECT: update(original, field, value) → returns new copy with change
```

Rationale: Immutable data prevents hidden side effects, makes debugging easier, and enables safe concurrency.

## Core Principles

### KISS (Keep It Simple)

- Prefer the simplest solution that actually works
- Avoid premature optimization
- Optimize for clarity over cleverness

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Extract repeated logic into shared functions or utilities
- Avoid copy-paste implementation drift
- Introduce abstractions when repetition is real, not speculative

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

- Do not build features or abstractions before they are needed
- Avoid speculative generality
- Start simple, then refactor when the pressure is real

## File Organization

MANY SMALL FILES > FEW LARGE FILES:

- High cohesion, low coupling
- 200-400 lines typical, 800 max
- Extract utilities from large modules
- Organize by feature/domain, not by type

## Error Handling

ALWAYS handle errors comprehensively:

- Handle errors explicitly at every level
- Provide user-friendly error messages in UI-facing code
- Log detailed error context on the server side
- Never silently swallow errors

## Input Validation

ALWAYS validate at system boundaries:

- Validate all user input before processing
- Use schema-based validation where available
- Fail fast with clear error messages
- Never trust external data (API responses, user input, file content)

## Naming Conventions

Language-specific case conventions take precedence — see the relevant language style guide (`style-guide-{js-ts,python,java,html-css}.md`) for details.

Shared principles:

- Use descriptive identifiers that communicate intent
- Variables / functions / methods: **follow the language's standard case**
  - JS / TS / Java: `camelCase`
  - Python: `snake_case`
- Types / classes / interfaces / components: `PascalCase` (all languages)
- Constants (module-level, truly immutable): `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (all languages)
- Booleans: `is`, `has`, `should`, `can` prefixes — Python uses snake_case forms like `is_ready` / `has_value` (`is` alone is a reserved word)
- React custom hooks: `camelCase` with a `use` prefix (`useUserProfile`)

## Code Smells to Avoid

### Deep Nesting

Prefer early returns over nested conditionals once the logic starts stacking.

### Magic Numbers

Use named constants for meaningful thresholds, delays, and limits.

### Long Functions

Split large functions into focused pieces with clear responsibilities.

## Code Quality Checklist

Before marking work complete:

- [ ] Code is readable and well-named
- [ ] Functions are small (<50 lines)
- [ ] Files are focused (<800 lines)
- [ ] No deep nesting (>4 levels)
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use constants or config)
- [ ] No mutation (immutable patterns used)
